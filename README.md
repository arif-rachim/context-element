# _data-group_
_`data-group`_ HTMLElement makes it easy for you to create web pages that can display data dynamically without having to use a framework

_`data-group`_ is a very small (3kb gzip). It can render an array of data efficiently and quickly. You can directly use _`data-group`_ on the html page by supplying `arrays` to the attribute `data` into the _`data-group`_ element. You can determine how the data will be displayed by creating a template inside the _`data-group`_.

## Motivation
To build interactive html pages and display data dynamically, we can use a front-end `framework/library` that has an engine to detect data changes and render these pages in a browser efficiently.

The framework will organize how pages are displayed based on the template that we define as components.

_`data-group`_ have similarities as frameworks, but data-groups are not frameworks engine, rather than simple **`HTMLElement`** that can organize how data is displayed based on templates.
