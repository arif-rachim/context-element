# _context-element_
**_`context-element`_** is an HTMLElement that makes it easy to render data or array in html page.

**_`context-element`_** is a very small (3kb gzip). It can render an array of data efficiently and quickly. You can directly use **_`context-element`_** on the html page by supplying `arrays or object` to the attribute `data` into the **_`context-element`_** element. You can determine how the data will be displayed by creating a template inside the **_`context-element`_**.

## Motivation
To build interactive html pages and display data dynamically, we can use a front-end `framework/library` that has an engine to detect data changes and render these pages in a browser efficiently.

The framework will organize how pages are displayed based on the template that we define as components.

**_`context-element`_** have similarities as frameworks, but context-elements are not frameworks engine, rather than simple **`HTMLElement`** that can organize how data is displayed based on templates.
